								<p>If there is enough interest in the club, we will purchase a Diamond DA-40 similar to the one pictured above. The Diamond is an excellent aircraft that is a joy to fly but it also happens to have an excellent <a href="http://www.diamondaircraft.com/about-diamond/safety-features/" target="_blank">saftey record</a>.

								<h2 class="major">Club Rates</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We strive to keep the club rates as affordable as possible. We operate as a non-profit and will adjust the rates up or down as needed to refelect the actual costs</p>
								<p>Current rate estimates* as of February 2018:</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Inital Buy-in Deposit: $5500</li>
									<li>Monthly Dues: $110</li>
									<li>Dry Hourly Rate (Hobbs): $45/hr</li>
								</ul>
								<p>*Note: The club is still in the formation phase. Once an aircraft has been purchased more specific details will be posted.</p>
								<p><b><u>Insurance:</u></b> Members are named insureds on the club insurance policy.  That means that the insurance company can’t subrogate against you.  Most FBO insurance policies cover only the FBO.  If the FBO’s insurance company believes the renter pilot is responsible for an insured aircraft loss, the insurance company will reimburse the FBO, and then go after the renter pilot for the loss (a process called subrogation.)</p>
								<p><b><u>Fuel:</u></b> The cost of fuel is not included in the aircraft rate (i.e. dry rates.)</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About the Club</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The club is in the formation phase. This webpage was put up to gauge the interest level in the club as described. Please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> if you are interested in joining the club or if you have any questions.</p>
								<p>The DC Diamond Pilots Club was formed to give affordabe access to a modern aircraft in the DC area. After completing the private pilot training, pilots are often stuck with the restrictive policies of flight schools or FBOs when attempting to fly for fun. Flying clubs are a great way for pilots who cannot afford to own their own plane to have access to a plane to use at a reasonable rate.</p>
								<p>We are based at KHEF in Manassas Virginia. See the <a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KHEF "target="_blank">AirNav page</a> for more information</p>
